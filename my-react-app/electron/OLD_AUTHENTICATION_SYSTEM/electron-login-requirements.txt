# Requirements / install instructions for `my-react-app/electron/login-authentication-system`
# Use PowerShell on Windows. Run from that folder.

# 1) Basic install (recommended)
# Installs all dependencies and devDependencies listed in package.json
npm install

# 2) New IPC-based approach (this repo has been migrated)
# Install the lightweight pure-JS bcrypt implementation used by the Electron main process
npm install bcryptjs@^2.4.3

# Notes / prerequisites
# - This project no longer requires starting an Express auth server; authentication runs inside the Electron main process
#   using IPC and a local JSON user store (`electron/users.json`).
# - If you still prefer the previous Express-based server, those files remain in the `login-authentication-system` folder,
#   but the Electron main process was updated to use IPC-based auth instead.
# - Install Node.js (LTS) and npm: https://nodejs.org/
